## Developing

- Make sure you have `cargo-leptos` installed. If you don't, run `cargo install cargo-leptos` to install it, then run `cargo leptos --version` to check that it works.
- To start a development server, run `cargo leptos watch`. This builds the server and frontend, and watches the code for changes, reloading the page as needed.
