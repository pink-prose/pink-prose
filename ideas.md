Loose idea document / very loose roadmap-ish of sorts

## Unsorted

everything goes

- epub uploads for easy import
- multifandom or "multisection" more generally speaking, I suppose
  - you have to "add" or "enable" a fandom to see it in a combined interface?
  - or you have to "context switch" between different fandoms to see their content?
  - admins of different fandoms can setup default available themes for the fandom
- custom themes, and custom dark/light themes depending on device setting
- need site moderators, I'd think these are per fandom/section
- bans, per fandom/section, or sitewide?
- omega customisable reader
  - custom fonts from ex. google fonts?
- markdown (not like fimfic's bbcode)
  - reverse fimd type of tool? I'd think it would be stored in this repo
  - markdown with some standard extensions (like gfm, and discord's \_\_underline formatting method\_\_)
- need good name
  - going to use our (meadowsys's) or silk's domain temporarily if needed in the meantime
- (assuming we do this) if there are no likes or dislikes, the bar should default fill green or be colourless, unlike fimfic's red, which is just a feel bad
- tagging system: like derpi?
  - or maybe two tiers of tags, one "officially approved" tags, and another one below of anything goes, like derpi does it
  - I like derpi's tag based search (gonna keep fulltext search, and as default, though)
  - story owners can put who can edit their tags (only themself, certain people can suggest, or certain people can edit, public can suggest, or public can edit)
  - basically like, come up with some kind of search syntax
  - filters like derpi
- maturity rating system, similar if not same as fimfic (E, T, M)
  - this would probably go with the tagging system too, and its filters
- likes/dislikes, with show/hide setting
  - user can choose to hide their likes/dislikes, or show only to friends(?)
  - should story author be able to control if others can see like/dislike on their stories?
- historical data
- friend system? follow system? or does mutual follow count as friends or should that be something else? hmmm
- cover rules follow story rating, maybe
- collaborative writing in editor
- similar are as collab writing, allow multiple authors in a story
- dynamically turn off parts of the site in response to catastrophic bugs? or something like that
- ID based, monotonically increasing IDs
  - don't reuse IDs of deleted/etc stories
- user timezone settings of course
- actual deletion
  - goes to rubbish bin for ~30 days, if for some reason we have moderation requirement to access that story we can only do so within those 30 days, after which its yeeted permanently
- look into GDPR
- multi-fandom crossover stories that post to multiple fandoms?
- multi-fandom/section profiles
  - not 100% sure how to handle it
  - silk suggested "pinning" a fandom, so when you're on other fandom spaces it says "from &lt;fandom&gt;" or something
  - I thought maybe different profiles for different fandoms, even though same account
- a Good API
  - internally frontend will use the same API that we would expose to developers
- yoink [fimfic feature requests](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ODO__7LHj0Lc_DEgAhjlkiYvMfN0_K5y7wgFUvUjUxo/edit?usp=sharing) for ideas LEL
- how do we host?
- featured stories hmmmmm
- license section for stories
- ability to "link related stories", kinda like fimfic's sequel function, but also for things like alternative versions of stories (translations etc?)
- I think we have no reason to disallow chat stories or green text stories
- license field
  - if story has permissive license, add a "remix" button to stories?
  - author should be able to turn this off I think
- tag blacklist (global blacklist, like they can't exist)
- total site ranking and per fandom ranking
- need a name need a name
- UI localisation
- what should we do with approval
- page to request new fandom creation, or maybe "application"
- read history (private or public)
- readlist
- allow other authors to write prequels to a story
  - "request sequel link", requesting original author to show the sequel on the story page
  - but I think the link should be allowed anyways, it just wouldn't show up on original story's page without original permission, but the prequel story would show up on the sequel's page
